# The STRESS guidelines: a 1st review and update - summary of analysis (By FA)

 
## Overview

171 studies have been reviewed that cited the original STRESS guideline in their reference lists using Google Scholar. After removing duplicates, 165 unique studies were identified. Of these, 73 studies explicitly claimed to have used the guideline to report their simulation studies. However, only 45 of these studies applied all elements of the guideline. In the remaining 28 studies, certain elements were either partially applied or omitted. For instance, while most studies reported elements such as "objective" and "logic," many did not fully address "implementation" or "code access," with some only mentioning parts of the implementation process.

Of all the studies that used the STRESS guideline, 14 were authored or co-authored by at least one of the original guideline's developers. The fact that 14 studies involving the original authors adhered to the guideline suggests that the creators of STRESS are actively contributing to the body of research and applying their own framework. 


Research Questions
1. How many references are using STRESS to document their model versus general citation and discussion (how else has STRESS been used).

73 studies claimed to use the STRESS guideline to report their simulation work. This could be further break down to:

Full Use of the STRESS Guideline: 45 studies used all elements of the guideline.
Partial Use of the STRESS Guideline: 28 studies applied only some elements.

From the 165 unique studies, subtracting the 73 that claimed to use the guideline leaves 92 studies that cited STRESS in a more general way, without directly using it to document their own models. Some papers cited STRESS to compare it with other simulation reporting framework such as the study by Pawel et al. (2022) and Moallemi et al. (2020). Researchers used STRESS to critique or discuss existing methodologies, offering insights into its strengths or limitations. Furthermore, in a study conducted by Howick et al. (2024), authors offer insights for extending the STRESS to encompass hybrid simulation, with a focus on SD and ABS hybridisation. Moreover, there were 17 literature reviews in the dataset (out of 165 papers), highlighting the guideline being recognised as a key framework in broader discussions within the academic community.

2. How has the used in terms of documenting models changed over time.
Fig 3. Examining the studies that used STRESS over time reveals a notable increase in its adoption since its publication in 2019. The highest usage occurred in 2022, with 18 papers out of 73 employing the guideline, followed by 17 papers in both 2021 and 2023. This upward trend demonstrates growing recognition and acceptance of the STRESS guideline within the academic community. This rise may be attributed to the increasing use of simulation studies, where clear reporting standards become essential for transparency and reproducibility. It also highlights the importance of continuing to update and refine the guideline to ensure it meets the evolving needs of simulation researchers.



3. What is the breakdown of the literature that used STRESS for DES, SD and ABS
Fig 2. In terms of simulation methods, DES was the most commonly used, appearing in 38 papers, followed by ABS in 14 papers. Additionally, seven studies employed hybrid simulation approaches, underscoring the need to extend the guideline to better accommodate the reporting of hybrid simulations. There were also five SD models which used the guideline.

4. Has STRESS been used to document any hybrid simulation models? If so how has it been used (e.g. multiple checklists); have modifications been introduced have alterantive guidelines been used?
Yes, STRESS has been utilized to document hybrid simulation models, as evidenced by the seven studies that employed hybrid simulation approaches while referencing the guideline.
- Three DES+ABS, 
- Two SD+ABS, 
- One ABS+SD+DES
- and, one Monte Carlo + machine learning
Researchers may have integrated elements from both STRESS and other relevant guidelines to comprehensively report their hybrid models such as the study by Allen et al. (2020) which used TRIPOD protocol for reporting machine learning and STRESS for Monte Carlo.
Some of these studies have adapted the STRESS guideline to better fit the unique requirements of hybrid simulations, potentially introducing modifications or additional reporting elements tailored to the complexities of these models. For example, in the SD+ABS model of Shukla et al (2022), they employed the guideline in a structured way in the paper's main text, although not all aspects of their ABS model has been reported (while most of the elements have been reported for SD, only the logic element has been described for ABS). 


5. What are the fields of application where STRESS has been used? (e.g. manufacturing, healthcare etc)


6. How did authors use STRESS to document their models.
Checklist supplement pointing to paras, lines etc?
Sections within the main paper or appendix?
Something else?


7. Are there any sections of STRESS that caused authors problems?


8. How has each section of STRESS been used? Do any need to be clarified or rephrased?


9. Are additional sections or modifications to sections needed to improve model reporting (unclear if a review will answer this question.)


10. What modifications are needed to document a hybrid model?



## Notes
1. Study No. 43 provides valuable insights for extending the guideline to incorporate hybrid simulation approaches, particularly a conceptual framework for hybrid Agent-Based Modeling and System Dynamics (ABM+SD) models.
2. Study No. 51: Gadomski et al. (2021): The authors claim to have used the guideline, but there is no evidence supporting this claim.
3. Study No. 64: Conlon & Molloy (2023): This study refers to supplementary material for the guideline; however, I could not find the mentioned supplementary section or file.
4. Study No. 138: Stokes (2020): Reassessment needed! Although the author claims to have used the guideline, I was unable to locate the elements within the text.
5. Study No. 161: Hajlasz (2023): This thesis is not in English, so analysis has not been conducted. However, it appears that the author may have used the guideline. Further language support is needed for assessment.
