# Research Questions

> **WORK IN PROGRESS**: initial draft of questions. These are subject to change.

1. How many references are using STRESS to document their model versus general citation and discussion (how else has STRESS been used)
2. What was the uptake of STRESS over time?
3. What is the breakdown of the literature that used STRESS for DES, SD and ABS?
4. Has STRESS been used to document any hybrid simulation models? If so how has it been used (e.g. multiple checklists); have modifications been introduced have alternative guidelines been used? 
5. What are the fields of application where STRESS has been used? (e.g. manufacturing, healthcare etc)
6. How did authors use STRESS to structure their reporting of models?
    * Checklist supplement pointing to paras, lines etc.
    * Sections within the main paper or appendix
    * Other
    * Are there any sections of STRESS that caused authors problems?
7. How has each section of STRESS been used? Do any need to be clarified or rephrased?
8. Are additional sections or modifications to sections needed to improve model reporting?
10. What modifications are needed to document a hybrid model?
